											<h2 id="soft-skills">Soft skills</h2>
											<h3 id="team-enablement">Team enablement</h3>
											<p>Through a strong focus on team enablement, I have cultivated an environment where every team member feels supported, valued, and empowered to excel. This approach has earned me consistent praise, with every single person on my team expressing that they would choose to work with me again and recognizing me as the best manager they have ever had. My commitment to fostering collaboration and enabling individual success was further validated when all team members nominated me for the Collaboration Award, underscoring the trust and respect I have built within the team.</p>

											<h3 id="problem-solving">Problem solving</h3>
											<p>One leadership quality I pride myself on is my ability to solve problems — it's a challenge I genuinely enjoy. When I stepped into a leadership role, I inherited a team that lacked cohesion, cross-training, and a unified approach. I worked to break down silos by fostering a collaborative culture where each member shared their expertise — whether in voiceovers, storyboard development, Figma, or visual  — while still being recognized as a subject matter expert. I also identified a critical gap in our operations: the absence of a business continuity plan, which I took the initiative to develop. These efforts not only improved team synergy but also strengthened our resilience and delivery capabilities.</p>

											<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>
											<p>I constantly look for ways to deliver more, faster, without compromising quality. Whether streamlining processes, automating repetitive tasks, or refining workflows, I take pride in optimizing how work gets done. My focus on continuous improvement has consistently led to faster turnaround times, improved team productivity, and better outcomes for both internal stakeholders and end users.</p>

											<h3 id="strategic-planning">Strategic planning</h3>
											<p>In my role leading a cross-functional team that collaborates across multiple organizations, I have developed and executed strategic plans that align diverse stakeholders toward common goals. By facilitating clear communication and coordination among various departments, I ensure our initiatives are efficiently prioritized and effectively implemented. One VP even remarked that I am the only person he has seen who can bring together a group of VPs and actually get decisions made. My strategic planning approach drives collaboration, optimizes resources, and delivers measurable results that support both short- and long-term organizational objectives.</p>

											<h2 id="hard-skills">Hard skills</h2>
											<h3 id="measure">Performance measurement</h3>
											<p>As the first manager in our organization to implement metrics tracking using JIRA, I spearheaded a system that significantly enhanced our visibility into project progress and team performance. The success and insight gained from this initiative led to the VP adopting similar metrics systems across all teams within the organization. 
												By designing tailored queries and customized boards, I empowered team members to clearly understand their tasks and priorities, resulting in improved efficiency and streamlined workflows. My proactive approach to leveraging JIRA has proven instrumental in driving transparency and productivity throughout the teams I manage.
												</p>
											<h3 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h3>
											<p>I am very familiar with Microsoft’s suite of applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint (PPT), <a href="visual-examples.html#sharepoint" target="_blank">SharePoint</a>, <a href="visual-examples.html#OneDrive" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>, <a href="visual-examples.html#stream" target="_blank">Stream</a>, and <a href="visual-examples.html#lists" target="_blank">Lists</a> to name a few. I have developed both team and communication SharePoint sites, which improved our ability to support our customers by making key information easily accessible. Additionally, I implemented a OneDrive-based system to streamline the sharing and archiving of deliverables, enhancing team collaboration and efficiency.</p>

											<h3 id="figma">Figma</h3>
											<p>I led the development of a scalable diagramming system in Figma that enabled our team to efficiently create consistent technical and architecture diagrams. By designing a library of components, I established a standardized visual language that streamlined collaboration, improved clarity, and aligned our documentation practices across the organization. With our collection of standardized templates, we significantly increased production while ensuring consistent deliverables across the company’s various websites. </p>

											<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
											<p>I created a comprehensive documentation of all my team’s workflows, tools, and systems, creating a centralized knowledge base to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency across the team. This effort enabled us to onboard new hires quickly and effectively, while also allowing us to communicate updates and process changes with minimal disruption. The result was a more agile, informed, and self-sufficient team.</p>
